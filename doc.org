* Documentation of different workflows using this tool
  For my own reference
** Importing old notes into org-roam
   This requires [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] to be installed
   #+begin_src bash
     # Create the binary if not already done
     cargo build

     # Create a skeleton for the note in org-roam. Contents will be added in next command
     ./target/debug/rissois import -p created ~/Dropbox/notes/Gevent.md ~/Dropbox/RoamNotes

     # Use pandoc to convert from markdown to org,
     # remove the unnecessary property drawers,
     # hard indent the org content,
     # then append the output to the org roam file created by the previous command
     pandoc -t org ~/Dropbox/notes/Gevent.md | sed -E "/^[[:space:]]?:/ d" | ./target/debug/rissois indent --stdin >> ~/Dropbox/RoamNotes/20130221223303-gevent.org
   #+end_src

   Open the file in emacs and verify that everything is correctly imported.

   Then run ~org-roam-db-sync~ from emacs to update the org-roam db as
   the file was added externally.

   Finally, remove the old notes file to clear up the space
   #+begin_src bash
     rm ~/Dropbox/notes/Gevent.md
   #+end_src

** Syncing files from Apple notes
   For now the workflow is very rudimentary and manual, but can be
   improved later.
*** Exporting apple notes to pdf
    - This can be done by "printing" the file into pdf
    - The pdf is exported to Dropbox folder =~/Dropbox/appleNotesSync=
*** Importing from pdf in dropbox
    Example:
    #+begin_src bash
      cargo run -- pdf-import ~/Dropbox/appleNotesSync/Pgconf\ India\ 2025.pdf ~/organon/roam
    #+end_src
**** (Optional) Delete the file in dropbox
**** (Delete) Delete the file in apple notes
